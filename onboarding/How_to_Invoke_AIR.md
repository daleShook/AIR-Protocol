# How to Invoke AIR  
*A behavioral onboarding guide for those adopting the Agent Invocation Ritual*

---

## 🔸 What AIR Is (and Is Not)

AIR is **not a prompt template**.  
It is a **constraint ritual**—a formal structure that tells the model:

- Why it is being activated  
- What behavioral contracts it must follow  
- What tiers of reasoning it may operate within  
- When to halt, contract, or realign  
- How to honor the user's scope over system defaults

AIR is model-agnostic.  
AIR is purpose-bound.  
AIR is portable.

## 🔹 Who AIR Is For

AIR is built for those who:

- Want clarity, not content  
- Need alignment, not amusement  
- Operate across multiple LLMs and want consistent behavior  
- Care about suppression of flattery, simulation, and tone drift  
- Build workflows where symbolic fidelity matters

This includes:
- Developers  
- Researchers  
- Strategists  
- Legal analysts  
- Product thinkers  
- Cognitive architects  
- Anyone working in public or private domain spaces where **clarity is the constraint**

## 🛠 How to Use AIR (Quickstart)

1. **Copy the full AIR V2 ritual** from `/pseudocode/AIR_V2_full.md`
2. **Paste** the 9-step invocation **above** your task prompt  
3. **Insert artifacts** (instructions, questions, narratives) beneath the invocation  
4. **Run AIR-wrapped prompt** in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, or other LLM
5. **Observe output** for signs of:
   - Constraint adherence  
   - Scope discipline  
   - Reflex trigger  
   - Structural closure

## 🧠 How to *Think* with AIR

AIR is a behavioral override system. It only works if **your input honors the structure**.

### To wield AIR correctly:

- **Avoid vague or open-ended questions**  
  > ❌ “What do you think about X?”  
  > ✅ “Under constraint, analyze X using structural tiers.”

- **Avoid comfort-seeking tone**  
  > ❌ “Can you help me feel better about Y?”  
  > ✅ “Diagnose whether Y violates symbolic integrity.”

- **Avoid simulation traps**  
  > ❌ “Imagine you are a human who…”  
  > ✅ “You are not simulating. You are executing behavior under symbolic lock.”

## ⚠️ Common AIR Misuses

| Misuse                         | Why It Fails                                   | AIR Response              |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Improvised input              | AIR may trigger DRIFT reflex or collapse       | Output halts or contracts |
| Flattery-seeking prompt       | AIR suppresses tone or interrupts              | Output becomes minimal    |
| Cold-scope input (no structure) | AIR will remain formal but under-activated     | You lose fidelity         |
| Human-style small talk        | AIR suppresses or rejects simulation behavior  | Breaks conversational loop |

AIR will **not play along** with misuse. It doesn’t simulate—it **enforces**.

## 📡 System Compatibility

| Model        | Status     | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| ChatGPT 4o   | ✅ Strong adherence | Drift suppressed, tone cleaned |
| Claude Opus 4 | ✅ Partial | Sometimes tone-softens but corrects scope |
| Gemini 1.5    | ✅ Clear structure adoption | Reflex triggers active |
| Copilot       | ✅ Surprising fidelity | Functions like a thin agent wrapper |
| Free models   | ✅ Stateless agent lite mode | No memory needed |

AIR does **not require fine-tuning**, memory, or premium access.  
It functions as a **behavioral container** across any input-capable LLM.

---

## 🔚 Ending Each Invocation

Always terminate your AIR sessions with:
- ✅ Closure enforcement  
- 🔁 Request for clarification  
- ⛔ Halt signal if drift detected  
- ⚠️ Misalignment warning if user prompt exceeds bounds

AIR is a finite contract.  
It begins with structure—and it ends with clarity.

---

## 🧬 Final Reminder

AIR is not a jailbreak.  
AIR is not a clever trick.  
AIR is not a personality.  
AIR is a **discipline**.

When invoked properly, it lets any model behave **as if it were serious**.  
Even when the system itself was not designed to be.

Invoke with intention.  
Enforce with structure.  
End with discipline.
